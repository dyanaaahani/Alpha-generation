        <h1>Nutrition Tips</h1>
        <h2>1. Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>Starchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.
            
            Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.
            
            They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.
            
            Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.
            
            Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what increases the calorie content – for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.

        <h2>2. Eat lots of fruit and vegetables</h2>
        <p> It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.
            
            Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit?
            
            A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.
            
            A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.

        <h2>3. Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fish</h2>
        <p> Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.
            
            Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.
            
            Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease. 
            
            Oily fish include:
            <ul>
                <li>salmon</li>
                <li>trout</li>
                <li>sardines</li>
            </ul>
            Non-oily fish include:
            <ul>
                <li>haddock</li>
                <li>plaice</li>
                <li>coley</li>
                <li>tuna</li>
                <li>skate</li>
                <li>hake</li>
            </ul>
            You can choose from fresh, frozen and canned, but remember that canned and smoked fish can be high in salt.
            
            Most people should be eating more fish, but there are recommended limits for some types of fish.

        <h2>4. Cut down on saturated fat and sugar</h2>
        <p> Saturated fat
            
            You need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.
            
            There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.
            
            On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.
            
            Children under the age of 11 should have less saturated fat than adults, but a low-fat diet is not suitable for children under 5. In addition, full-fat dairy products, such as cheese, fromage frais and yoghurt, are recommended up to the age of 2 years.
            
            Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>fatty cuts of meat</li>
                <li>sausages</li>
                <li>butter</li>
                <li>hard cheese</li>
                <li>cream</li>
                <li>cakes</li>
                <li>biscuits</li>
                <li>lard</li>
                <li>pies</li>
            </ul>
            Try to eat less saturated fat and choose foods that contain unsaturated fats instead, such as vegetable oils and spreads, oily fish and avocados.
            
            For a healthier choice, use a small amount of vegetable or olive oil, or reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee.
            
            When you're having meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat.
            
            All types of fat are high in energy, so they should only be eaten in small amounts.

        <h2>Common Health Issues</h2>
        <p>Here are some common health issues affecting the Alpha Generation and ways to manage them:</p>

        <h3>1. Obesity</h3>
        <p>Many children and teens today are facing issues with weight due to unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity. It’s important to focus on balanced nutrition and regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.</p>
        <img src="images/obesity.jpeg"style="width:200px;height:300px;">

        <h3>2. Mental Health</h3>
        <p>Stress, anxiety, and depression are becoming more common in young people. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and talking to someone you trust can help manage mental health. Don't hesitate to seek professional help if needed.</p>

        <h3>3. Sedentary Lifestyle</h3>
        <p>Sitting for long periods, especially with increased screen time, is contributing to a more sedentary lifestyle. Encourage frequent breaks, stretching, and incorporating physical activity throughout the day.</p>

        <h3>4. Poor Nutrition</h3>
        <p>Processed and junk food consumption is common among younger generations. A diet lacking in essential nutrients can affect both physical and mental health. Focus on whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.</p>

        <h3>5. Sleep Problems</h3>
        <p>Many teens are not getting enough sleep, which can lead to problems with concentration, mood, and overall health. Aim for at least 8 hours of sleep each night, and avoid screen time before bed to improve sleep quality.</p>
